Final Readme

This scene depicts a basement pool table. There is a pool table, lights hanging above the table, a bookcase, and a picture. There is a floor and a ceiling that are visible with the light turned up. Fog can also be enabled or disable. I am most proud of the pool table and pool balls. I believe the pockets and the balls look very realistic. I hope to add to this later and make an actual functioning pool game. I also think the fog adds a really cool touch.
